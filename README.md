# Angular Front-End for AISSCV-LEGO

Welcome to the Angular front-end repository for our AISSCV-LEGO prototype. This interface serves as the assembly assistant for the Lego Mindstorms assembly process. Designed to streamline and assist users in their building projects, this application seamlessly connects to the Jetson Nano, forming a bridge between advanced object recognition and a user-friendly interface.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.4.
